# Travel Automation System

A desktop app I built for planning trips. It helps you organize cities, hotels, places to visit, and keep track of your travel budget.

## What it does

- **User login/register** - basic authentication system
- **Dashboard** - see your trips at a glance with an interactive map (OpenStreetMap)
- **Cities** - add and manage cities you want to visit
- **Hotels** - save hotel info for each destination
- **Places** - keep track of interesting spots with coordinates
- **Budget tracker** - manage your travel expenses
- **AI Assistant** - get travel suggestions (experimental)

## Tech stack

- C# Windows Forms (.NET Framework)
- Entity Framework for database
- OpenStreetMap for maps
- SQLite/SQL Server for data storage

## How to run

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `geziOtomasyonProjesi.sln` in Visual Studio
3. Restore NuGet packages
4. Build and run
